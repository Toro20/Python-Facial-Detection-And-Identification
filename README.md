# Python Facial Detection
This is a facial detection and identification program written in python using the OpenCV library.
In order to use, add images to the "faces" folder of the individuals who you wish to identify. A camera must also be connected to the device as this is where the video stream comes from.
To quit the program simply press the 'q' key.

# Identification
If a face is detected and the face has been identified inside of the "faces" folder, then the persons name will be displayed on screen with a border along with the accuracy of the detection.

If there is a face detected that has not been identified under the "faces" folder, then the program will instead present the word "unknown" around the border where the face is detected. This is because the program has detected a face that is has not been able to identify.
